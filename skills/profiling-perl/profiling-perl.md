  Profile and diagnose slow code with
  Devel::NYTProf, then analyze the report to find the hotspot and
  propose a fix. Generate a profile by running the page's Perl entry
  point (generally a .pl script) under -d:NYTProf, render it with
  nytprofhtml, read the flame graph and per-line costs, and quantify
  the real-world saving. Use when a user reports a script as is slow,
  asks "why is this page slow" for a perl CGI or PSGI app,
  "profile X", "where is the time going", mentions NYTProf / a flame
  graph, or wants a performance hotspot analyzed in the
  repo. Always deletes the profile artifacts when done.

# Performance Profiling — NYTProf Skill

Perl code almost always has a Perl script/cgi/psgi entry point that
processes data. Many things can be done slowly following from there,
and [Devel::NYTProf](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::NYTProf)
profiles the whole run so the hotspot(s) are visible.

Workflow: generate the profile → render it → find the hotspot → fix →
re-profile to confirm.

## ⚠️ Security — artifacts embed full source

The `nytprof.out` file **and** the generated HTML report contain the
complete source of every file touched during the run UNLESS the
savesrc=0 attribute is set in the NYTPROF env var.
Treat them as sensitive regardless, better safe than sorry.

- Write them to a path only privileged users can read (`/tmp` on a dev
  box is fine; never a web-accessible docroot).
- **Delete every artifact when you are done** — see
  [Clean up](#7-clean-up-always). Do not leave `nytprof.out` or the
  `nytprof/` report directory lying around.

## Prerequisites

- `Devel::NYTProf` installed and `nytprofhtml` available in `$PATH`.

## 1. Identify the entry point for the page

Map the route the user cares about to a Perl invocation:
```
/path/to/script.pl arg1 arg2...
```

## 2. Generate the profile

Pick the mode that matches the context. The pattern is always: set the
`NYTPROF` env var to `file=<outfile>`, then run the entry
point under `perl -d:NYTProf`. Point `file=` wherever you want the
`.out` — you'll `cd` there before rendering. If you want to exclude BEGIN,
then you could do `start=init:file=<outfile>` as well. This can be useful
in PSGI contexts where BEGIN usually processes during service startup time
and not in the context of user requests or when profiling individual
subroutines in modules.

**Perl/CGI Scripts:**

```bash
NYTPROF=file=/tmp/nytprof.out \
  perl -d:NYTProf /path/to/script.pl arg1 >/tmp/page.out 2>/tmp/page.err
```
If it is a CGI script, you may need to set CGI vars ahead of time like REMOTE_USER, etc.,
as you are calling the script outside of the normal webserver's context.

**Perl Modules/PSGI routes:**

Typically PSGI codepaths are encapsulated into modules. This makes profiling
these very similar to profiling perl modules. In this case you want to identify
what subroutine corresponds to the path the user takes through the application.

```bash
NYTPROF=start=init:file=/tmp/nytprof.out \
  perl -d:NYTProf -MMy::Module -e 'do_something()' >/tmp/page.out 2>/tmp/page.err
```

**Run script as another user:**

```bash
export NYTPROF=start=init:file=/home/luser/nytprof.out
sudo --preserve-env=NYTPROF -u luser \
  perl -d:NYTProf \
  /path/to/script.pl arg1 >/tmp/page.out 2>/tmp/page.err
```

Check the run: exit code `0`, `/tmp/page.err` empty (or only benign
warnings), and the `.out` file exists and is non-trivial in size. The
captured stdout (`/tmp/page.out`) is the output of the code in question.

> Match the `file=` path to a directory the running user can write.
> In user mode that means the user's homedir (`/home/luser/...`),
> not `/tmp` or some other dir they may not be able to write to.

## 3. Render the HTML report

`nytprofhtml` writes an `nytprof/` directory **next to where you run
it**, so `cd` to the `.out` location first:

```bash
cd "$(dirname /home/luser/nytprof.out)"        # or /tmp
nytprofhtml --file ./nytprof.out --out ./nytprof
ls ./nytprof/index.html
```

If the run was as another user, render as that user too (or `chown` the
`.out` first) so permissions line up:
`sudo -u luser nytprofhtml --file /home/luser/nytprof.out --out /home/luser/nytprof`.

Copy `nytprof/` somewhere convenient to read if needed — but remember
the [security rule](#️-security--artifacts-embed-full-source).

## 4. Analyze

Open `nytprof/index.html`. Reading the report:

- The **flame graph**: X axis = time spent in each call stack; Y axis =
  call-stack depth. Wide bricks are where the time goes. Click a brick
  to drill into the source with per-line costs (in seconds / fractions).
- The **top-subroutines** and **per-file** tables rank by exclusive and
  inclusive time.

Fast, scriptable triage without a browser — grep the report for a
suspected module and sum its cost:

```bash
# Which modules show up, and how often
grep -oE "DateTime[A-Za-z:/_]*" nytprof/index.html | sort | uniq -c

# Headline: "Profile of <script> for <wall time>"
grep -oE "Profile of [^<]+for [0-9.]+s" nytprof/index.html | head -1

# Sum per-file load time for a module family (adjust the regex)
perl -0777 -ne 'my $t=0; while(/<tr[^>]*>(.*?)<\/tr>/sg){my $r=$1; next unless $r=~m{DateTime[\w/]*\.pm</a>}; my @c=($r=~/<td[^>]*>(.*?)<\/td>/sg); s/<[^>]+>//g for @c; for my $c (@c){ if($c=~/([0-9.]+)(ms|µs|s)$/){my($n,$u)=($1,$2); $n*=1000 if $u eq "s"; $n/=1000 if $u eq "µs"; $t+=$n; last}}} printf "summed: %.1f ms\n",$t' nytprof/index.html
```

**The profiler inflates everything** (often 5–20×), so treat absolute
times as *relative*. To get the real-world saving of removing/lazy-loading
a module, measure the load cost directly, without the profiler:

```bash
./3rdparty/bin/perl -e 'use Time::HiRes qw(time); my $s=time; require DateTime; require DateTime::Format::ISO8601; printf "%.1f ms\n",(time-$s)*1000;'
```

Compare against a lightweight replacement if the culprit is a module load.
Sometimes the only dependency you might need from a heavyweight module is
one or two subroutines. Often there are alternatives on the CPAN that
do what you need. In the above example, it could be argued that if all you
needed was what strftime from POSIX could have given you, you probably
didn't need to load all of DateTime even if it winds up being a bit more
code to write.

## 5. Common culprits → fixes

- **Expensive module loaded at compile time.** A `use Heavy::Module ();`
  at the top of a module that runs in the render/daemon path. Fixes:
  swap for a lightweight equivalent or `require` it lazily inside
  the one sub that needs it.
- **Data fetched synchronously that can be fetched asynchronously**
  Fetching something from a slow database query and blocking
  load versus using coroutines or forking to process other things while
  processing that slow operation.
  Enumeration via synchronous logic "in-template" vs. asynchronous API
  calls in JS via whatever UI your CGI/PSGI script has.
- **Repeated work** that should be cached either to file or to memory via
  memoization.

After a fix, **re-profile the same way** and confirm the hotspot is
gone (grep the new report; it should no longer mention the module), and
confirm with the profiler-free load-time measurement.

## 6. Clean up (always)

Profiling artifacts embed source — remove them when finished:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/nytprof.out /tmp/page.out /tmp/page.err
rm -rf /tmp/nytprof
# realistic mode:
rm -rf /home/cptest/nytprof.out /home/cptest/nytprof
```

If you copied the report elsewhere to read it, delete that copy too.

## Troubleshooting

- **`nytprofhtml: command not found`** — it's not on `PATH`; this can
  commonly occur if perl was installed with perlbrew. Make sure the
  PERLBREW\_HOME variable is set and points to the right place.
- **Empty / tiny `nytprof.out`** — the process died before profiling
  flushed. Check `/tmp/page.err`; ensure the entry point and argument
  are correct, and that `REMOTE_USER` / `sudo -u` user exists.
- **Permission denied rendering** — the `.out` is owned by the run
  user; render as that user (`sudo -u`) or `chown` it first, and make
  sure `file=` was writable by the run user.
- **`Ignoring '#line ...' directive` warnings from nytprofhtml** —
  harmless; Template.pm compiles templates with `#line` markers that
  don't map back cleanly. The report is still valid.
- **Times look implausibly large** — that's profiler overhead. Use the
  `Time::HiRes` direct measurement for real numbers.
